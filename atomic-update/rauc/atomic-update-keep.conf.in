## When an atomic update is applied, all changes made in /etc will be lost.
## The only exceptions are the files and directories listed below.
## If you want to preserve additional files, you can create drop-in '*.conf'
## files in "@atomic_update_conf_d@/".
## Indiscriminately preserving /etc files increases the risk of encountering
## unexpected behavior, please proceed only if you know what you are doing.
##
## Before /etc changes gets removed, a backup is created in @etc_backup_dir@
##
## The wildcard '*' will match every character, except forward slashes.
## The wildcard '**' is like '*', but it will include forward slashes.
