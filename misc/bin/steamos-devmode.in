A small helper script to enable developer mode on SteamOS.
It does the following:
  - Disables read-only mode.
  - Populates the pacman keyring.
  - Restores missing files stripped from the shipping image of SteamOS (ie. headers, etc) so you can build your own software.

If you wish to re-enable readonly mode after using this script, you can use the "steamos-readonly disable" command.

If status reports "enabled", you can still run "enable" again to restore packages if you mess up. ;)
